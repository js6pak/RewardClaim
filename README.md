# RewardClaim

A fork of [Dance-Dog/RewardClaim](https://github.com/Dance-Dog/RewardClaim) but actually working +
- sounds
- no "Ready?" button
- dailystreak info
- [ ] ads for unranked (currently unranked just can't use this mod)

## Installation
1. Get a .jar from [releases](https://github.com/js6pak/RewardClaim/releases) or CI
2. Drop it into the mods
3. You are done! :)

## Licensing
[Original](https://github.com/Dance-Dog/RewardClaim) didn't have any license thus its ARR, I'd like to contact [Dance-Dog](https://github.com/Dance-Dog) but seems like he vanished in 2020, which means I might need to rewrite whole thing from scratch in future
